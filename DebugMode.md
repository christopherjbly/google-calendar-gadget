# Debug Mode #

If you're having problems, please follow these instructions to help us diagnose issues:
  * Download this file http://desktop.google.com/plugins/GoogleCalendar2.gg
  * Unzip that file to a directory (it's really just a zip file).
  * Within the directory, double-click or execute the gadget.gmanifest file.

Running the gadget this way allows you to see error message dialogs. If you see an error dialog, please [report an issue](http://code.google.com/p/google-calendar-gadget/issues/list).

Cheers!
