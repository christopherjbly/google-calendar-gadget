# Introduction #

I started this page to 'break the ice' since it appears I am the first one to start talking. I was invited to test the project by James Yum and encouraged to share my impressions here in the Google Code project. If the project owners have a different vision for feedback please let us know.


# First Impressions #

Here are a couple of things I noticed when I first installed the gadget. I will provide more specific and detailed data as I explore the gadget more. I am sharing these details from memory and will refine terms once I am home and have access to the gadget.

1. Visual appeal
  * I like the choice of font, color, and shape.
  * The Calendar header, text, and dates seems larger than necessary. Given my meek 1400x900 resolution, the calendar+agenda take up about half of my sidebar.
    * This is one of the reasons for the agenda only view. If there is only very limited space available. The font size is already at 8 and even smaller fonts would be impossible to read at higher resolutions.
  * It seems some non-All day events are indented a lot. Is this intended?
    * I changed this and moved them all a bit more to the left. Some events in am/pm mode will have more space since I don't want to recalculate every time I add events and I need enough space for something like "12:30a".
  * I had two events at the same time and the second event did not list a time, but was instead indented even more. Is this intended?
    * Yes, this is by design.

2. Navigation
  * I would encourage you to include the up and down arrows present on the agenda view without calendar to the with calendar view
    * There is only very little space available and I don't see where this would fit in.
  * I like that the Event view includes all of the data stored in the event and does not require additional clicks.
  * I like the year view navigation (A feature long requested of the main Google Calendar)

3. Questions I plan to try to answer for myself
  * Is the calendar data available offline?
    * While there is a cache the gadget does not store the events on the machine permanently. So there is currently no way to use the gadget offline.
  * Does the gadget function both on Google Desktop and iGoogle?
  * Is this a read-only gadget? Can we not edit events from within the gadget?
    * You can add, but not edit.

4. Wish List
  * I found myself somewhat disappointed when I moved the gadget out of the sidebar. I had expected something similar to the expanded Canvas view gadget for iGoogle.

P.S. DLW edited this page and I cannot see a way to see what he changed (if anything). Is this a rollback history in Code like in Docs?
